Statistical Plots & Distribution Analysis
📌 Project Description

This project demonstrates the use of statistical visualization techniques to explore and analyze data distributions. Histograms, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots, and boxplots are used to inspect distribution patterns, compare groups, identify outliers, and understand skewness and spread.

🎯 Objectives

Visualize data distributions using histograms and KDE plots

Compare distributions across different groups (Region A vs Region B)

Detect outliers using boxplots

Analyze skewness and variability in the data

Export plots and provide a concise interpretation

📊 Analysis Performed

Histogram & KDE to understand the shape and skewness of the data

Grouped visualizations to compare Region A and Region B

Boxplots to detect outliers and analyze spread

🧠 Key Findings

Region B exhibits higher values and greater variability

The overall distribution is right-skewed due to high-value outliers

Region A shows a more compact and consistent distribution

Boxplots clearly highlight outliers and differences in spread

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

📝 Interpretation

A one-paragraph interpretation summarizing the distribution characteristics, outliers, skewness, and spread is included at the end of the Jupyter Notebook.
